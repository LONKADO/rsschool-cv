        <p>
          My English skills development did not start at school, since childhood
          I consumed content only in English, since my uncle tried to instill
          knowledge of English in me from an early age, school helped me correct
          my knowledge of grammar, and then from 10-12 years old I went to
          London every summer to my uncle and communicated there with native
          speakers and in parallel studied for a year with my aunt, a tutor in
          English, and also very often interacted in various chats and groups
          with native speakers of English.
