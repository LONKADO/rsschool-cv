## Summary

I have been passionate about programming for over four years now and have become an experienced Python developer and senior. My work has not been limited to projects only â€“ I have also shared my knowledge by teaching and mentoring others in Python programming. This has given me not only development experience but also recognition as an effective teacher. Now I have decided to take on a new challenge and delve deeper into the world of web frontend development to expand my skills and learn new technologies.
